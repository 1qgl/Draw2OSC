# Draw2OSC
A python program that allows the user to control a polyphonic VCV Rack synth by drawing freehand curves for the automation of pitch or other control voltage parameters. This was done to make it easier to make microtonal modular synth music.

The program communicates with VCV Rack through OSC (through the trowaSoft cvOSCcv module). It makes creating melodies and harmonies, especially microtonal ones, super easy since they can just be drawn on a chart kind of like a piano roll (but not quantized to 12 tone equal temperment).

Here's what an example of a chord progression:
